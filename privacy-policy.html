        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p class="last-updated">Last Updated: January 2025</p>

        <div class="highlight-box">
            <p>Rally Score respects your privacy. We do not collect, store, or transmit any personal information or user data to external servers. Your data stays on your device, always.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>Rally Score is designed with privacy at its core. This privacy policy explains how we handle (or rather, don't handle) your data.</p>

        <h2>Data Collection</h2>
        <p>Rally Score does <strong>not</strong> collect, store, or transmit any personal information or user data to external servers. We have no servers, no databases, and no way to access your information.</p>

        <h2>Local Data Storage</h2>
        <p>All match data is stored exclusively on your local device using SwiftData (Apple's modern data persistence framework). This includes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Team names you enter</li>
            <li>Player names and configurations</li>
            <li>Match scores and rally history</li>
            <li>Match completion times and duration</li>
            <li>App settings and preferences</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This data <strong>never leaves your device</strong> and is not accessible to us, Apple (beyond standard iOS backups), or any third parties.</p>

        <h2>Device-to-Device Communication</h2>
        <p>Rally Score uses Apple's WatchConnectivity framework to sync match data between your Apple Watch and iPhone. This communication happens:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Locally between your paired devices only</li>
            <li>Over Bluetooth or local WiFi</li>
            <li>Without any internet connection required</li>
            <li>Without any data being sent to external servers</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>iCloud Sync</h2>
        <p>Rally Score does not currently use iCloud sync. All data remains exclusively on your local devices. If we implement iCloud sync in future versions, we will update this policy and notify users before enabling the feature.</p>

        <h2>Analytics & Tracking</h2>
        <p>Rally Score does <strong>not</strong> use:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Analytics services</li>
            <li>Tracking SDKs</li>
            <li>Usage data collection</li>
            <li>Crash reporting services (beyond Apple's standard crash logs)</li>
            <li>Advertising networks</li>
            <li>Any form of user behavior monitoring</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We have no idea how you use the app, and we like it that way.</p>

        <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>Rally Score does not integrate with any third-party services, SDKs, analytics platforms, or external APIs. The app is completely self-contained and offline-first.</p>

        <h2>Location Services</h2>
        <p>Rally Score does not request or use your location data in any way.</p>

        <h2>Camera & Photos</h2>
        <p>Rally Score does not access your camera or photo library.</p>

        <h2>Contacts & Calendar</h2>
        <p>Rally Score does not access your contacts, calendar, or any other personal information stored on your device.</p>

        <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
        <p>Rally Score does not knowingly collect any information from anyone, including children under 13. The app is suitable for all ages and contains no objectionable content. Since we don't collect any data at all, there are no special considerations for children's privacy.</p>

        <h2>Apple's Standard Data Collection</h2>
        <p>While Rally Score itself collects no data, Apple may collect standard information as part of the App Store and iOS ecosystem, including:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>App download and update information</li>
            <li>Crash logs (if the app crashes and you opt in to share crash data with Apple)</li>
            <li>Device backups to iCloud (if you enable iCloud Backup in iOS Settings)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This data is collected by Apple, not by Rally Score, and is governed by <a href="https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/" target="_blank">Apple's Privacy Policy</a>.</p>

        <h2>Your iOS Backup</h2>
        <p>If you enable iCloud Backup or iTunes backups on your device, your Rally Score match data will be included in those backups as part of standard iOS app data backup. This is an iOS system feature we don't control. Your backups are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Encrypted by Apple</li>
            <li>Accessible only to you via your Apple ID</li>
            <li>Not accessible to Rally Score developers</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Data Retention & Deletion</h2>
        <p>Since all data is stored locally on your device:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>You can delete individual matches in the Match History screen</li>
            <li>You can delete all app data by deleting the Rally Score app from your device</li>
            <li>We have no copies of your data and cannot help you recover deleted data</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Data Security</h2>
        <p>Your match data is protected by:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>iOS's standard app sandboxing (no other apps can access Rally Score data)</li>
            <li>Device-level encryption (if you enable device passcode/Face ID/Touch ID)</li>
            <li>No network transmission means no risk of interception</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Your Rights</h2>
        <p>Since Rally Score collects no personal data, standard data privacy rights (access, correction, deletion, portability) are inherently satisfied. You have complete control over your data because it exists only on your device.</p>

        <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update this privacy policy from time to time to reflect changes in the app or legal requirements. Any changes will be posted on this page. If we make material changes that affect how we handle data, we will notify users through the app or App Store update notes.</p>

        <h2>International Users</h2>
        <p>Rally Score is available worldwide. Since we collect no data, there are no cross-border data transfer concerns. The app works the same way in all countries.</p>

            <strong>Response Time:</strong> Within 24-48 hours
        </p>

        <h2>Legal Compliance</h2>
        <p>This privacy policy is designed to comply with:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA)</li>
            <li>General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)</li>
            <li>Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA)</li>
            <li>Apple App Store privacy requirements</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Since Rally Score collects no personal data, compliance with these regulations is straightforward: we simply have no data to protect, process, or disclose.</p>
